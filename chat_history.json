You want to create a React Native app using Expo 54 that can run on Raspberry Pi OS and will be used by your staff to manage orders and complete training modules. Here's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n-   **Order Management:** A screen to view, update, and manage orders. This will likely involve displaying order details, status, and allowing staff to update the order status (e.g., \"Received,\" \"Processing,\" \"Shipped,\" \"Completed\").\n-   **Training Modules:** A section where staff can access and complete training modules. This could involve a list of available modules, progress tracking, and a way to view the training content (e.g., text, images, videos).\n-   **User Authentication:** A simple login/logout system to ensure only authorized staff can access the app.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\nLet's go with a clean and modern light theme for the app.\n\n-   **Colors:**\n    -   Background: `#f9f9f9` (Light gray for a clean look)\n    -   Text: `#212121` (Dark gray for readability)\n    -   TextSecondary: `#757575` (Medium gray for less important text)\n    -   Primary: `#03a9f4` (Light blue for primary actions)\n    -   Secondary: `#00bcd4` (Teal for secondary actions)\n    -   Accent: `#ff4081` (Pink for highlights and calls to action)\n    -   Card: `#ffffff` (White for cards and containers)\n    -   Highlight: `#bbdefb` (Very light blue for subtle highlights)\n-   **Typography:** Use the default system fonts for a native feel, ensuring readability on Raspberry Pi OS.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Create Order Management Screen:** Create a new file in the `app/(tabs)` directory called `orders.tsx`. This screen will display a list of orders and allow staff to view and update order details.\n2.  **Create Training Modules Screen:** Create a new file in the `app/(tabs)` directory called `training.tsx`. This screen will display a list of training modules and allow staff to access and complete them.\n3.  **Update Tab Layout:** Modify the `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` file to include the new \"Orders\" and \"Training\" tabs in the bottom tab navigation.\n4.  **Remove Modal Demos:** Remove the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` as it is not needed for the core functionality of the app.\n\nNow, I will instruct the coding agent to implement this plan. After the implementation, the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx should be removed.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-19T01:32:18.980341"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build an order management and training app for your staff that can run on Raspberry Pi OS.
